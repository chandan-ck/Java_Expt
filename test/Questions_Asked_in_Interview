OOPs concepts in your project
how polymerphism(give me some example)
if the method return type is different does that run time/compile time polymerphism

--- create susbset from given elements so that it will have min 3/given and the number should be between min-max range
	return the count
eg:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] min no of elem=3 min range=4 maxrange=7

{4,5,6}(4,5,7}{5,6,7}
so count =3

Diff bet Abstract class/interface
can we have constructor in Abstract class--if yes how the object getting created
Program ooutput
public class C {

	public static void main(String []args) {
		A ob=new A(1,"abx");
		m2(ob);
	}

	private static A m2(A obj) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		obj.setName("aaa");
		obj=new A(1,"xxxxx");
		System.out.println(obj.getName());
		
		return obj;
	}
}


what are the collections you had used in ur project
how the uniqueness and order is maintained in Set and tree respectively


---Design the music player with unique and random songs playlist at a time
---read a file and show the occurance of authors in the file---complexity and how can we improve 
---put object in set and when the unique ness check is called

Applied Materials:

-- Create optimal hashmap which can store only 3 element(no memory wastage)
-- Creata a prod ready doubly linkedlist that can do operation(add iterate reverse)
-- create a thread where the execution will be passed to diff thread for execution(print 1-10 in async manner)

wells fargo
-- design LRU cache
-- from a huge string find the first non repeating character.
-- Find the triplet from an array where the sum is a given number--find optimal solution
--What is the design patteren you use in micro servie.what are possible pattern
-- Which cloud you are using and how do you configure a new micro service
-- what are the things that needs to be taken care while creating other than code?
-- which private cloud you are using and what functionality of (cloudfoundry ) you are using

Implement CustomSet

CustomSet() Initializes the CustomSet object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the set if not present. Returns true if the item was not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the set if present. Returns true if the item was present, false otherwise.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

can we store objects in collections ?
If yes How to store a all unique objects in collections ?

The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days. For example, if the given array is {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}, the maximum profit can earned by buying on day 0, selling on day 3. Again buy on day 4 and sell on day 6. If the given array of prices is sorted in decreasing order, then profit cannot be earned at all.
